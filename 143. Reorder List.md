# 143. Reorder List | C++ Solution | Stack | Tortoise and Hare Algorithm & Three Pointers | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to reorder a singly linked list such that the first element is followed by the last element, then followed by the second element, then by the second last element, and so on. The first thought is to use a two-pointer approach to find the middle of the list, reverse the second half of the list, and then merge the two halves.

## Approach

1. **Stack**: We first check if the list is empty or has only one node, in which case we return immediately. We then initialize a stack to store the nodes of the list. We then iterate through the list and push each node onto the stack. We then calculate the size of the stack and initialize a pointer `current` to the head of the list. We then iterate through the first half of the list and pop each node from the stack. For each node, we insert it between `current` and `current->next` and move `current` two steps forward. We then set the `next` pointer of the last node to `NULL`.

2. **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm & Three Pointers**: We first check if the list is empty or has only one node, in which case we return immediately. We then initialize two pointers `slow` and `fast` to the head of the list. We move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward until `fast` reaches the end of the list. At this point, `slow` is at the middle of the list. We then reverse the list from `slow` to the end of the list. We move `slow` back to the head of the list and `fast` to the head of the reversed list. We then enter a loop that continues until `fast->next` is `NULL`. In each iteration of the loop, we insert `fast` between `slow` and `slow->next` and move `slow` and `fast` forward.

## Complexity

-   **Stack**:

    -   **Time complexity**: $O(n)$
    -   **Space complexity**: $O(n)$

-   **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm & Three Pointers**:
    -   **Time complexity**: $O(n)$
    -   **Space complexity**: $O(1)$

## Code

1. **Stack**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return;

        stack<ListNode*> s;
        ListNode* current = head;
        while (current != NULL) {
            s.push(current);
            current = current->next;
        }

        int n = s.size();
        current = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            ListNode* next = current->next;
            current->next = s.top();
            s.pop();
            current->next->next = next;
            current = next;
        }

        current->next = NULL;
    }
};
```

2. **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm & Three Pointers**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return;

        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        ListNode* previous = NULL;
        ListNode* current = slow;
        ListNode* forward = NULL;
        while (current != NULL) {
            forward = current->next;
            current->next = previous;
            previous = current;
            current = forward;
        }

        slow = head;
        fast = previous;
        while (fast->next != NULL) {
            forward = slow->next;
            slow->next = fast;
            slow = forward;

            forward = fast->next;
            fast->next = slow;
            fast = forward;
        }
    }
};
```
