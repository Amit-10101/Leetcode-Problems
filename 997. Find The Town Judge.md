# 997. Find The Town Judge | C++ Solution | O(n) | Array/Vector Approach | Beginner Friendly

## Intuition

The problem is asking to find the town judge. The town judge trusts nobody but everybody else trusts the town judge. This means that the town judge is the person who is trusted by `n-1` people and trusts nobody.

## Approach

The approach is to keep track of the trust count for each person. We create a 2D array where the first column represents the number of people that person trusts and the second column represents the number of people that trust that person. We iterate over the trust array and update the trust counts. Then we iterate over the 2D array and find the person who trusts nobody (first column is 0) and is trusted by `n-1` people (second column is `n-1`).

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$
-   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<vector<int>> temp(n, vector<int>(2,0));
        for (int i = 0; i < trust.size(); i++) {
            temp[trust[i][0] - 1][0]++;
            temp[trust[i][1] - 1][1]++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < temp.size(); i++) {
            if (temp[i][0] == 0 && temp[i][1] == n-1) return i+1;
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
