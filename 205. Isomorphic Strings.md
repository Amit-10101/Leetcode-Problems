# 205. Isomorphic Strings | C++ Solution | Hash Map | Hash Set | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to determine if two strings are isomorphic, meaning the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. The first thought is to use a hash map to store the mapping from `s` to `t` and a hash set to store the characters in `t` that have been mapped to.

## Approach

We initialize an empty hash map `um` and an empty hash set `us`. We then iterate over the characters in `s` and `t` simultaneously. If the current character in `s` is not in `um` and the current character in `t` is not in `us` ( meaning both characters have not been mapped to any other character ) , we add the mapping from the current character in `s` to the current character in `t` to `um` and add the current character in `t` to `us`. If the current character in `s` is in `um` but its mapped character is not the current character in `t`, we return `false`. After the loop, we return `true`.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** $O(n)$
-   **Space complexity:** $O(n)$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, char> um;
        unordered_set<char> us;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (um.find(s[i]) == um.end() && us.find(t[i]) == us.end()) {
                um[s[i]] = t[i];
                us.insert(t[i]);
            } else {
                if (um[s[i]] != t[i]) return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
