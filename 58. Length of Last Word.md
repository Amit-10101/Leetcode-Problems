# 58. Length of Last Word | C++ Solution | Backward Traversal

## Intuition

The problem is asking to return the length of the last word in a given string. The first thought is to traverse the string from the end and keep track of the length of the last word.

## Approach

We initialize a variable `length` to 0. We start from the end of the string and move backwards. If we encounter a space and `length` is not 0, we break the loop. If we encounter a non-space character, we increment `length`. After the loop, we return `length`.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** $O(n)$
-   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int length = 0;
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == ' ' && length != 0) {
                break;
            } else if (s[i] != ' ') {
                length++;
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
};
```
