# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | C++ Solution | Hash Table | Unordered Set | Unordered Map | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The first thought that comes to mind is to use a sliding window approach where we keep expanding the window until we encounter a repeating character, at which point we slide the window to exclude the repeating character and continue.

## Approach

1. **Hash Set - Unordered Set**: This approach involves using a hash set to keep track of the characters in the current window. We keep expanding the window and adding characters to the set until we encounter a repeating character, at which point we remove characters from the set starting from the left until the repeating character is removed.

2. **Hash Map - Unordered Map**: This is a further optimization of the second approach. Instead of using a set to keep track of the characters, we use a map to also store the index of each character. This allows us to instantly slide the window to exclude the repeating character when we encounter one, instead of having to remove characters one by one.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:**

    -   Hash Set: &nbsp;$O(n)$ &nbsp;&nbsp;[More precisely, $O(2n)$, because each character could be visited twice, once for insertion and once for removal]
    -   Hash Map: &nbsp;$O(n)$

-   **Space complexity:**
    -   Hash Set: &nbsp;$O(n)$
    -   Hash Map: &nbsp;$O(n)$

## Code

1. **Hash Set - Unordered Set**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int left = 0;
        unordered_set<char> us;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            while (us.find(s[right]) != us.end()) {
                us.erase(s[left]);
                left++;
            }
            us.insert(s[right]);
            maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

2. **Hash Map - Unordered Map**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int left = 0;
        unordered_map<char, int> um;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            if (um.find(s[right]) == um.end() || um[s[right]] < left) {
                um[s[right]] = right;
                maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
            } else {
                left = um[s[right]] + 1;
                um[s[right]] = right;
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
};
```
