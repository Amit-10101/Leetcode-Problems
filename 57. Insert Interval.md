# 57. Insert Interval | C++ Solution | Merge Intervals | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to insert a new interval into a list of non-overlapping intervals. The new interval could potentially overlap with some of the existing intervals. The first thought is to iterate through the existing intervals and handle three cases: the new interval is to the right of the current interval, the new interval is to the left of the current interval, or the new interval overlaps with the current interval.

## Approach

We iterate through the existing intervals. If the existing interval finishes before the new interval starts, we add the existing interval to the result. If the existing interval starts after the new interval or the existing interval finishes after the new interval starts, we merge the intervals. We do this by taking the minimum of the start times and the maximum of the end times. We do this till there are no more intervals to merge. We then add the new interval to the result and also add if any remaining intervals are left. Then we return the result.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** $O(n)$
-   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$ [Not counting the space required to store the result]

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {
        int n = intervals.size();
        vector<vector<int>> ans;

        int e = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) {
                ans.push_back(intervals[i]);
            } else if (intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) {
                newInterval[0] = min(intervals[i][0], newInterval[0]);
                newInterval[1] = max(intervals[i][1], newInterval[1]);
            } else {
                e = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        ans.push_back(newInterval);

        if (e != -1) {
            for (int i = e; i < n; i++) {
                ans.push_back(intervals[i]);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
