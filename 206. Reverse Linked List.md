# 206. Reverse Linked List | C++ Solution | Three Pointers | Stack | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to reverse a singly linked list. The first thought is to use three pointers: one to keep track of the previous node, one for the current node, and one for the next node. We then iteratively reverse the pointers from the current node to the previous node until we reach the end of the list.

> -   The pointers of the linked list have to be reversed, not the values.

## Approach

1. **Stack**: We can use a stack to store the nodes of the list. We first push all the nodes of the list onto the stack. We then pop the nodes from the stack and connect them in reverse order. We return the head of the reversed list.

2. **Three Pointers**: We first initialize three pointers: `previous` to `NULL`, `current` to the head of the list, and `forward` to `NULL`. We then enter a loop that continues until `current` is `NULL`. In each iteration of the loop, we move `forward` to the next node, reverse the pointer from `current` to `previous`, move `previous` to `current`, and move `current` to `forward`. After the loop, we delete `current` and `forward` and return `previous`, which is now the head of the reversed list.

## Complexity

-   **Stack**:

    -   **Time complexity**: $O(n)$,
    -   **Space complexity**: $O(n)$.

-   **Three Pointers**:
    -   **Time complexity**: $O(n)$,
    -   **Space complexity**: $O(1)$.

## Code

1. **Stack**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        stack<ListNode*> s;
        ListNode* current = head;
        while (current != NULL) {
            s.push(current);
            current = current->next;
        }

        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        current = dummy;
        while (!s.empty()) {
            current->next = s.top();
            s.pop();
            current = current->next;
        }
        current->next = NULL;

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

2. **Three Pointers**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* previous = NULL;
        ListNode* current = head;
        ListNode* forward = NULL;

        while (current != NULL) {
            forward = current->next;
            current->next = previous;
            previous = current;
            current = forward;
        }

        delete current;
        delete forward;

        return previous;
    }
};
```
