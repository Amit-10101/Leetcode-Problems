# 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach | C++ Solution | Greedy Algorithm | Priority Queue (Max Heap) | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem asks to find the furthest building you can reach with a given number of bricks and ladders. The first thought that comes to mind is to use the bricks for smaller heights and ladders for larger heights. This is because using a ladder can get us over any height, while the number of bricks is limited.

## Approach

1. We iterate over the array of building heights. For each pair of buildings, we calculate the difference in their heights.
2. If the difference is less than or equal to the number of bricks we have, we use the bricks and push the difference into a priority queue.
3. If the difference is more than the number of bricks we have but we still have ladders, we use a ladder. If the priority queue is not empty and the top of the queue (which is the largest difference we have encountered so far) is greater than the current difference, we can get a benefit by using the ladder for the previous larger difference and using the bricks for the current smaller difference.
4. If we can't use bricks or ladders to get to the next building, we stop and return the index of the furthest building we can reach.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n log n)$

-   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int furthestBuilding(vector<int>& heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
        int n = heights.size();
        int i = 0;
        priority_queue<int> pq;

        for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (heights[i] >= heights[i+1]) {
                continue;
            }
            int diff = heights[i+1] - heights[i];
            if (diff <= bricks) {
                bricks -= diff;
                pq.push(diff);
            } else if (ladders > 0) {
                if (pq.size()) {
                    int x = pq.top();
                    if (x > diff) {
                        bricks += x;
                        pq.pop();
                        pq.push(diff);
                        bricks -= diff;
                    }
                }
                ladders--;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        return i;
    }
};
```
