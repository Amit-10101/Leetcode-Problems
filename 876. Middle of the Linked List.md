# 876. Middle of the Linked List | C++ Solution | Array of Nodes | Count Nodes | Two Pointers / Fast and Slow | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to find the middle node of a linked list. The first thought that comes to mind is to use two pointers, one slow and one fast. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.

## Approach

1. **Array of Nodes:** Another approach is to put every node into an array in order and then return the middle element. This approach is straightforward but uses extra space.

2. **Count Nodes:** We can count the number of nodes in the list and then traverse the list again to find the middle node. This approach is also straightforward but requires two traversals of the list.

3. **Two Pointers / Fast and Slow:** We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, at the head of the list. We move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the middle of the list.

## Complexity

-   **Array of Nodes:**

    -   Time complexity: $O(n)$
    -   Space complexity: $O(n)$

-   **Count Nodes:**

    -   Time complexity: $O(n)$ (Double Pass/Traversals)
    -   Space complexity: $O(1)$

-   **Two Pointers / Fast and Slow:**
    -   Time complexity: $O(n)$ (Single Pass/Traversal)
    -   Space complexity: $O(1)$

## Code

1. **Array of Nodes**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        vector<ListNode*> nodes;
        ListNode* temp = head;

        while (temp != NULL) {
            nodes.push_back(temp);
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        return nodes[nodes.size() / 2];
    }
};
```

2. **Count Nodes**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        int count = 0;
        ListNode* temp = head;

        while (temp != NULL) {
            count++;
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        temp = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < count / 2; i++) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        return temp;
    }
};
```

3. **Two Pointers / Fast and Slow**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* fast = head;
        ListNode* slow = head;

        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
};
```
