# 1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists | C++ Solution | Two Pointers | Dummy Node | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to merge a second linked list into the first linked list between the nodes at index `a` and `b` (inclusive). The first thought is to find the nodes at index `a-1` and `b` in the first linked list, find the last node in the second linked list, and then connect the nodes appropriately.

## Approach

We first initialize two pointers `fast` and `slow` to the head of the first linked list and a pointer `dummy` to the head of the second linked list. We move `fast` `b` steps forward and `slow` `a-1` steps forward. We then move `dummy` to the last node in the second linked list. We connect `dummy` to the node after `fast`, connect `slow` to the head of the second linked list, and delete the node after `slow`.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** $O(n + m)$,
-   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeInBetween(ListNode* list1, int a, int b, ListNode* list2) {
        ListNode* dummy = list2;
        ListNode* fast = list1;
        ListNode* slow = list1;

        int i = 0;
        while (i < b) {
            fast = fast->next;
            i++;
        }

        i = 0;
        while (i < a-1) {
            slow = slow->next;
            i++;
        }

        while(dummy->next != NULL) {
            dummy = dummy->next;
        }
        dummy->next = fast->next;

        ListNode* delNode = slow->next;
        slow->next = list2;
        delete delNode;

        return list1;
    }
};
```
