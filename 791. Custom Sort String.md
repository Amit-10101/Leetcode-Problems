# 791. Custom Sort String | C++ Solution | Hash Map | Custom Sort | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to sort the string `s` in the same order as the characters appear in string `order`. We can solve this problem by using a Hash Map to store the frequency of each character in `s` and then construct the result string by appending characters in the order they appear in `order` and the remaining characters in any order.

## Approach

1. **Hash Map:** We first count the frequency of each character in `s` and store it in a hash map. Then we iterate over `order` and for each character, we append it to the result string as many times as its frequency in `s` and remove it from the map. Finally, we append the remaining characters in the map to the result string.

2. **Custom Sort:** We can also solve this problem by using a custom sort function. We can define a custom sort function that takes two characters `a` and `b` and returns `true` if `a` comes before `b` in `order`. Then we can use the `sort` function to sort the string `s` using the custom sort function. The custom comparator uses the orderMap to determine the order of the characters. If a character does not exist in the orderMap, its order is considered to be larger than any character in order because the default value for an integer in C++ is 0 and we have filled the orderMap with indices starting from 0.

## Complexity

-   **Hash Map:**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(n + m)$ where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `order` and `s` respectively.

    -   **Space complexity:** $O(m)$ for the Hash Map approach because we need to store all characters of `s` in a map.

-   **Custom Sort:**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(m \log m)$ where `m` is the length of `s` because we need to sort the string `s`.

    -   **Space complexity:** $O(n)$ for the Custom Sort approach because we need to store all characters of `order` in a map.

## Code

1. **Hash Map:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string customSortString(string order, string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> um;

        for (char c : s) {
            um[c]++;
        }

        string result = "";
        for (char c : order) {
            if (um.find(c) != um.end()) {
                for (int i = 0; i < um[c]; i++) {
                    result += c;
                }
                um.erase(c);
            }
        }

        if (!um.empty()) {
            for (auto p : um) {
                for (int i = 0; i < p.second; i++) {
                    result += p.first;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

2. **Custom Sort:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string customSortString(string order, string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> orderMap;
        for (int i = 0; i < order.size(); i++) {
            orderMap[order[i]] = i;
        }

        sort(s.begin(), s.end(), [&](char a, char b) {
            return orderMap[a] < orderMap[b];
        });

        return s;
    }
};
```
