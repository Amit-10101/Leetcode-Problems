# 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign | C++ Solution | Auxilary Array Approach | Optimized Two Pointer Approach

## Intuition

The problem asks us to rearrange the array elements by their sign. The first thought that comes to mind is to separate the positive and negative numbers, and then merge them in an alternate pattern.

## Approach

1. **Using Auxiliary Arrays**: The first approach involves creating two separate arrays for positive and negative numbers. We iterate over the original array and push the positive numbers into the positive array and the negative numbers into the negative array. Then, we merge these two arrays in an alternate pattern to get the final result.

2. **Using Two Pointers**: The second approach is an optimized version of the first one. Instead of using auxiliary arrays, we use two pointers, one for positive numbers and one for negative numbers. We iterate over the original array and place the positive numbers at the even indices and the negative numbers at the odd indices of the result array.

## Complexity

1. **Using Auxiliary Arrays**:

    - **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$
    - **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$

2. **Using Two Pointers**:
    - **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$
    - **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(1)$ <br />[Not considering the space required for output array]

## Code

1. **Using Auxiliary Arrays**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> positive, negative;
        vector<int> result(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                positive.push_back(nums[i]);
            } else {
                negative.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
        }

        int p = 0, m = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i+=2) {
            result[i] = positive[p++];
            result[i + 1] = negative[m++];
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

2. **Using Two Pointers**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> result(n);

        int positive = 0, negative = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                result[positive] = nums[i];
                positive += 2;
            } else {
                result[negative] = nums[i];
                negative += 2;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```
