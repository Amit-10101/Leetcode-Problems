# 3005. Count Elements with Maximum Frequency | C++ Solution | Hash Map | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to find the count of elements with the maximum frequency in the given array. The first thought that comes to mind is to use a hash map to count the frequency of each element in the array. Then, we can iterate over the hash map to find the maximum frequency and count the elements with this frequency.

## Approach

-   **Hash Map:** We initialize an empty hash map. We iterate over the array and for each element, we increment its count in the hash map. Then, we iterate over the hash map. For each entry, if the frequency is greater than the current maximum frequency, we update the maximum frequency and reset the count. If the frequency is equal to the maximum frequency, we add the frequency to the count.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** $O(n)$
-   **Space complexity:** $O(n)$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> um;

        for (int i : nums) {
            um[i]++;
        }

        int max = INT_MIN;
        int ans = 0;
        for (auto i : um) {
            if (max < i.second) {
                max = i.second;
                ans = 0;
            }
            if (max == i.second) {
                ans += i.second;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
