# 88. Merge Sorted Array | C++ Solution | Optimized Approach | Two Pointers Approach | Recursive Approach | Insert and Sort Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to merge two sorted arrays. The first thought that comes to mind is to use a two-pointer technique where each pointer points to the end of each array. We compare the elements at the pointers and place the larger one at the end of the first array.

## Approach

1. **Two Pointers / Iterative Approach:** We use two pointers, one for each array, starting from the end. We compare the elements at the pointers and place the larger one at the end of the first array. We continue this process until we've processed all elements from the second array.

2. **Recursive Approach:** We can also solve this problem using recursion. We compare the last elements of the arrays and place the larger one at the end of the first array. Then we make a recursive call for the rest of the arrays.

3. **Insert and Sort Approach:** We can also solve this problem by inserting all elements of the second array into the first array and then sorting the first array. This approach is simpler but less efficient.

## Complexity

-   **Two Pointers:**

    -   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$ because we make one pass through the arrays.
    -   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(1)$ because we don't use any additional space.

-   **Recursive Approach:**

    -   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$ because we make one pass through the arrays.
    -   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$ because of the recursive calls.

-   **Insert and Sort Approach:**
    -   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n \log n)$ because we sort the first array.
    -   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(1)$ because we don't use any additional space.

## Code

1. **Two Pointers:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        int i = m - 1, j = n - 1;
        int k = m + n - 1;

        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                nums1[k--] = nums1[i--];
            } else {
                nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
            }
        }

        while (j >= 0) {
            nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
        }
    }
};
```

2. **Recursive Approach:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return;
        }

        if (m == 0 || nums2[n - 1] > nums1[m - 1]) {
            nums1[m + n - 1] = nums2[n - 1];
            merge(nums1, m, nums2, n - 1);
        } else {
            nums1[m + n - 1] = nums1[m - 1];
            merge(nums1, m - 1, nums2, n);
        }
    }
};
```

3. **Insert and Sort Approach:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            nums1[m + i] = nums2[i];
        }

        sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    }
};
```
