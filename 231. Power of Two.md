# 231. Power of Two | C++ Solution | Optimized Approach | Iterative & Bit Manipulation

## Intuition

The problem is asking to check if a given number is a power of two. The first thing that comes to mind is that a number is a power of two if it can be divided by two repeatedly until we reach the number one. If at any point during this process, the number is not divisible by two, then it is not a power of two.

## Approach

1. **Iterative Division:**
   The approach is straightforward. We start by checking if the number is less than or equal to zero, in which case we return false because negative numbers and zero are not powers of two. If the number is one, we return true because one is a power of two (2^0 = 1).
   Then we enter a loop where we keep dividing the number by two as long as it is greater than one. If at any point the number is not divisible by two (i.e., it has a remainder when divided by two), we return false because it is not a power of two. If we can divide the number by two until we reach one, we return true because the number is a power of two.

2. **Bit Manipulation:**
   This approach uses the property of numbers that are powers of two. These numbers have exactly one bit set in their binary representation. If `n` is a power of two, then `n & (n - 1)` will be zero. This is because `n - 1` will have all the bits set to the right of the set bit in `n`. So, `n & (n - 1)` will unset the set bit in `n`, resulting in zero.

## Complexity

-   **Iterative Division**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(\log n)$
    -   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

-   **Bit Manipulation**
    -   **Time complexity:** $O(1)$
    -   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

## Code

1. **Iterative Division**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return false;
        if (n == 1) return true;

        while (n > 1) {**
            if (n % 2 != 0) {
                return false;
            }
            n /= 2;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

2. **Bit Manipulation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
};
```
