# 100. Same Tree | C++ Solution | Breadth-First Search (BFS) | Depth-First Search (DFS) | Optimized Approach

# Intuition

The problem is asking to determine whether two binary trees are the same. Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

# Approach

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** We can use BFS to traverse each tree and store the values of the nodes in a vector. We also store a special value for null nodes to handle the case where two trees are structurally different. Then we compare the two vectors. If they are the same, then the two trees are the same.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We can use DFS to recursively compare the nodes of the two trees. Two nodes p and q are the same if and only if p->val == q->val and the left children of p and q are the same and the right children of p and q are the same.

# Complexity

-   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(n)$ (Because we visit each node once, where n is the number of nodes in the tree)
    -   **Space complexity:** $O(n)$ (Because we store the values of the nodes in a vector, and queue in helper function)

-   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(n)$ (Because we visit each node once, where n is the number of nodes in the tree)
    -   **Space complexity:** $O(n)$ in the worst case when the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g., each node has only left child node, and $O(\log n)$ in the best case when the tree is completely balanced.

# Code

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void helper(TreeNode* p, vector<int>& x) {
        queue<TreeNode*> q1;
        TreeNode* temp1 = p;

        x.push_back(temp1->val);
        q1.push(temp1);
        while (!q1.empty()) {
            TreeNode* front = q1.front();
            q1.pop();

            if (front->left != NULL) {
                q1.push(front->left);
                x.push_back(front->left->val);
            } else {
                x.push_back(-99);
            }
            if (front->right != NULL) {
                q1.push(front->right);
                x.push_back(front->right->val);
            } else {
                x.push_back(-99);
            }
        }
    }

    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (p == NULL && q == NULL) return true;
        if (p == NULL || q == NULL) return false;

        vector<int> pv;
        vector<int> qv;

        helper(p, pv);
        helper(q, qv);

        if (pv.size() != qv.size()) return false;

        for (int i = 0; i < pv.size(); i++) {
            if (pv[i] != qv[i]) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (p == NULL && q == NULL) return true;
        if (p == NULL || q == NULL) return false;
        if (p->val != q->val) return false;
        return isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
    }
};
```
