# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array | C++ Solution | Optimized Approach | Two Pointers Approach | Square and Sort Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to return an array of the squares of each number in the input array, in non-decreasing order. The first thought that comes to mind is to square each number and then sort the array. However, since the input array is already sorted (though in non-decreasing order by the number's value, not its square), we can take advantage of this property to avoid the need for sorting.

## Approach

1. **Two Pointers Approach:** We use two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and one at the end. We compare the absolute values at the two pointers, square the larger one, and place it at the end of the result array. Then we move the pointer inward from the larger absolute value and repeat this process until we've filled the result array.

2. **Square and Sort Approach:** We can also solve this problem by squaring each number and then sorting the array. This approach is simpler but less efficient.

## Complexity

-   **Two Pointers Approach:**

    -   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$ because we make one pass through the array.
    -   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$ because we store the result array.

-   **Square and Sort Approach:**
    -   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n \log n)$ because we sort the array.
    -   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(1)$ because we don't create any additional arrays and used the input array to store the result.

## Code

1. **Two Pointers Approach**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(n);

        int left = 0, right = n - 1;

        for (int k = n - 1; k >= 0; k--) {
            if (abs(nums[right]) > abs(nums[left])) {
                ans[k] = nums[right] * nums[right];
                right--;
            } else {
                ans[k] = nums[left] * nums[left];
                left++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

2. **Square and Sort Approach**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            nums[i] *= nums[i];
        }

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        return nums;
    }
};
```
