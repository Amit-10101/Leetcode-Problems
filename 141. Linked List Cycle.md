# 141. Linked List Cycle | C++ Solution | Hash Set | Two Pointers / Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm / Tortoise and Hare Algorithm | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to determine if a linked list has a cycle in it. The first thought that comes to mind is to use a hash set to store visited nodes. If we encounter a node that is already in the hash set, it means there is a cycle.

## Approach

1. **Hash Set:** We use a hash set to store visited nodes. We traverse the list one node at a time, and for each node, we check if it is in the hash set. If it is, we return true indicating there is a cycle. If it is not, we add it to the hash set and move on to the next node. If we reach the end of the list without finding a cycle, we return false.

2. **Two Pointers / Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm:** This approach uses two pointers, one slow and one fast. The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.

## Complexity

-   **Hash Set:**

    -   Time complexity: $O(n)$
    -   Space complexity: $O(n)$

-   **Two Pointers / Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm:**

    -   Time complexity: $O(n)$
    -   Space complexity: $O(1)$

## Code

1. **Hash Set**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (head == NULL) return false;

        unordered_set<ListNode*> us;

        ListNode* temp = head;
        while (temp->next != NULL) {
            if (us.find(temp) != us.end()) return true;
            else us.insert(temp);
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

2. **Two Pointers / Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return false;

        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head->next;

        while (slow != fast) {
            if (fast == NULL || fast->next == NULL) return false;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```
