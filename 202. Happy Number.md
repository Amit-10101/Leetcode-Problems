# 202. Happy Number | C++ Solution | Hash Set | Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to determine if a number is a happy number. A happy number is a number that eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. If a number is not happy, it will enter a cycle that does not include 1. The first thought is to use a data structure that can store the numbers we have seen to detect a cycle. We can use a hash set to store the numbers we have seen and check if a number is in the hash set. While, we keep calculating the next number until we reach 1 or a number we have seen before.

## Approach

1. **Hash Set**: We first define a helper function `next` that calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of a number. We then initialize a hash set to store the numbers we have seen. We enter a loop that continues until `n` is 1 or `n` is in the hash set. In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the next number `n` and add it to the hash set. If `n` is 1, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`. We also return `false` if `n` is in the hash set to avoid an infinite loop.

2. **Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm**: We first define a helper function `next` that calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of a number. We then initialize two pointers `slow` and `fast` to `n` and `next(n)`, respectively. We enter a loop that continues until `fast` is 1 or `fast` equals `slow`. In each iteration of the loop, we move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward. If `fast` is 1, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

## Complexity

-   **Hash Set**:

    -   **Time complexity**: $O(\log n)$
    -   **Space complexity**: $O(\log n)$

-   **Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm**:
    -   **Time complexity**: $O(\log n)$
    -   **Space complexity**: $O(1)$

## Code

1. **Hash Set**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int next(int n){
        int sum = 0;

        while(n != 0){
            int rem = n % 10;
            sum += (rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        return sum;
    }

    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;

        while(n != 1 && seen.find(n) == seen.end()){
            seen.insert(n);
            n = next(n);
        }

        return n == 1;
    }
};
```

2. **Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm**:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int next(int n){
        int sum = 0;

        while(n != 0){
            int rem = n % 10;
            sum += (rem * rem);
            n = n / 10;
        }

        return sum;
    }

    bool isHappy(int n) {
        int slow = n;
        int fast = next(n);

        while(fast != 1 && fast != slow){
            slow = next(slow);
            fast = next(next(fast));
        }

        return fast == 1;
    }
};
```
