# 1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals | C++ Solution | Hash Map | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem asks to find the least number of unique integers after removing `k` elements from the array. The first thought that comes to mind is to count the frequency of each integer in the array. Then, we can remove the integers with the least frequency first until we have removed `k` elements. This way, we can minimize the number of unique integers left in the array.

## Approach

1. First, we create an unordered map to count the frequency of each integer in the array.
2. Then, we put all the frequencies into a vector and sort it in ascending order. The reason for sorting is to ensure that we remove the integers with the least frequency first.
3. We then iterate over the sorted frequencies, adding each frequency to a `sum` until `sum` equals or exceeds `k`. The number of unique integers left is the total number of frequencies minus the number of frequencies we have added to `sum` until it reached `k`.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** $O(n log n)$

-   **Space complexity:** $O(n)$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> um;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (um.find(arr[i]) == um.end()) {
                um[arr[i]] = 1;
            } else {
                um[arr[i]] = ++um[arr[i]];
            }
        }

        vector<int> freq;
        for (auto x : um) {
            freq.push_back(x.second);
        }
        sort(freq.begin(), freq.end());

        int answer = 0, sum = 0;
        while (count < freq.size() + 1) {
            if (sum == k) {
                answer = freq.size() - count;
                break;
            } else if (sum > k) {
                answer = freq.size() - count + 1;
                break;
            }

            sum += freq[count];

            count++;
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
```
