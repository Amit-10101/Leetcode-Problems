# 2971. Find Polygon with the Largest Perimeter | C++ Solution | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem asks us to find the polygon with the largest perimeter. The first thought that comes to mind is that to form a polygon, the length of any side must be less than the sum of the lengths of the other sides. Therefore, we need to find the largest set of numbers that satisfy this condition.

## Approach

The approach involves sorting the array in ascending order and then iterating over it from the end. We maintain a sum of all elements and in each iteration, we subtract the current element from the sum. If the current element is less than the sum (which represents the sum of the other sides), we have found our polygon and return the sum of the current element and the sum. If we reach the start of the array without finding such a set, we return -1 indicating that no polygon can be formed.

## Complexity

-   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n \log n)$

-   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(1)$

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long largestPerimeter(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n < 3) {
            return -1;
        }

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        long long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            sum -= nums[i];
            if (nums[i] < sum) {
                return (nums[i] + sum);
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
