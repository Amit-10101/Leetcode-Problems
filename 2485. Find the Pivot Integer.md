# 2485. Find the Pivot Integer | C++ Solution | Forward & Backward Sum | Mathematical Approach | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to find a pivot integer `x` such that the sum of all integers from `1` to `x` is equal to the sum of all integers from `x` to `n`. This can be solved by using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. We can find the pivot integer by taking the square root of the total sum.

## Approach

-   **Forward & Backward Sum:** We can solve this problem by calculating the sum of all integers from `1` to `n` and the sum of all integers from `n` till both sums are equal. If the sums are equal, it means that the point where the sums are equal is the pivot integer. If not, there is no pivot integer, so we return `-1`.

-   **Mathematical Approach:** We first calculate the sum of all integers from `1` to `n` using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. We then take sum of all integers from `1` to `x` and sum of all integers from `x + 1` to `n`. If both sums are equal, it means that `x` is the pivot integer. We can find the pivot integer by taking the square root of the total sum. If the square of the square root is equal to the total sum, it means that the pivot integer exists, so we return the square root. If not, there is no pivot integer, so we return `-1`.

## Mathematical Proof for the Approach

-   Sum of all integers from `1` to `n` = `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`
-   Sum of all integers from `1` to `x` = `((x * (x + 1)) / 2)`
-   Sum of all integers from `1` to `x-1` = `((x-1) * x) / 2`
-   Sum of all integers from `x` to `n` = `((n * (n + 1)) / 2) - (((x-1) * x) / 2)`

According to the problem, the sum of all integers from `1` to `x` should be equal to the sum of all integers from `x + 1` to `n`. So, we can write the equation as:

-   `((x * (x + 1)) / 2) = ((n * (n + 1)) / 2) - (((x-1) * x) / 2)`
-   `x^2 + x = n^2 + n - x^2 + x`
-   `2x^2 = n^2 + n`
-   `x^2 = (n^2 + n) / 2`
-   `x = sqrt((n^2 + n) / 2)`
-   `x = sqrt(n * (n + 1) / 2)`

Last but not least, we need to check if the square of the square root is equal to the total sum. If it is, it means that the pivot integer exists, so we return the square root. If not, as the sqrt function can return a floating-point number which is not a valid pivot integer, we return `-1`.

## Complexity

-   **Forward & Backward Sum:**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(n)$
    -   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

-   **Mathematical Approach:**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(1)$ / $O(\log n)$
        > **Note:** In this solution, we are using the formula to calculate the pivot integer. The `sqrt` function used in the formula has a time complexity of $O(1)$ in some compilers. This is because it is implemented using a hardware instruction (Look Up Table) on most modern CPUs, which means it takes a constant amount of time to execute, regardless of the size of the input. While, In some compilers, the sqrt() function can take $O(\log n)$ for calculating square root manually.
    -   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

## Code

1. **Forward & Backward Sum:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pivotInteger(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        int ans = -1;

        // Maths Formula for Sum of First n Natural Numbers
        int forwardSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;

        // Another Way: Loop for Forward Sum
        // for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        //     forwardSum += i;
        // }

        int backwardSum = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            forwardSum -= n;
            backwardSum += n;
            if (forwardSum + n == backwardSum) {
                ans = n;
                break;
            }
            n--;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

2.  **Mathematical Approach:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pivotInteger(int n) {
        int sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
        int x = sqrt(sum);

        if (x * x == sum) {
            return x;
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```
