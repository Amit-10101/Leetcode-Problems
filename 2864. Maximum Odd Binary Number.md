# 2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number | C++ Solution | Iterative Approach | Sorting Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to find the maximum odd binary number that can be formed from the given string. The first thought that comes to mind is to count the number of 1s and 0s in the string. Since we want to maximize the binary number and it should be odd, we can place all 1s at the beginning except one, then place all 0s, and finally place the last 1. This will ensure that the binary number is maximum and odd.

## Approach

1. **Iterative Approach:** We iterate over the string and count the number of 1s and 0s. Then we construct the answer string by placing all 1s at the beginning except one, then placing all 0s, and finally placing the last 1.

2. **Sorting Approach:** We can sort the string in descending order and then place the first 1 at the end of the string.

## Complexity

-   **Iterative Approach:**

    -   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$ because we iterate over the string once.
    -   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$ because we store the answer string.

-   **Sorting Approach:**

    -   **Time complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n \log n)$ because we sort the string.
    -   **Space complexity:** &nbsp;$O(n)$ because we store the answer string.

## Code

1. **Iterative Approach**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string maximumOddBinaryNumber(string s) {
        int zeroCount = 0;
        int oneCount = 0;

        for (char i : s) {
            if (i == '1') oneCount++;
            else if (i == '0') zeroCount++;
        }

        string ans = "";
        while (oneCount > 1) {
            ans += '1';
            oneCount--;
        }
        while (zeroCount >= 1) {
            ans += '0';
            zeroCount--;
        }

        ans += '1';

        return ans;
    }
};
```

2. **Sorting Approach**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string maximumOddBinaryNumber(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        sort(s.begin(), s.end(), greater<char>());

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                swap(s[i], s[n - 1]);
                break;
            }
        }


        return s;
    }
};
```
