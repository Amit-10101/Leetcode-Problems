# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons | C++ Solution | Greedy Approach | Starting Interval Sort | Ending Interval Sort | Optimized Approach

## Intuition

The problem is asking to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons. Each balloon is represented as a horizontal line segment where `x start` and `x end` denote the start and end coordinates of the balloon, respectively. An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis and a balloon with `x start` and `x end` bursts by an arrow shot at `x` if `x start ≤ x ≤ x end`. The first thought is to sort the balloons by their end points and then greedily shoot arrows at the end point of the current balloon.

## Approach

We first sort the balloons by their end points. We then initialize the end point to be the end point of the first balloon and the number of arrows to be 1. We iterate through the rest of the balloons. If the current balloon starts before the end point, we update the end point to be the minimum of the current end point and the end point of the current balloon. If the current balloon starts after the end point, we update the end point to be the end point of the current balloon and increment the number of arrows.

## Complexity

-   **Starting Interval Sort:**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(n \log n)$
    -   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

-   **Ending Interval Sort:**

    -   **Time complexity:** $O(n \log n)$
    -   **Space complexity:** $O(1)$

## Code

1. **Starting Interval Sort:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        int arrows = 1;

        sort(points.begin(), points.end());

        int end = points[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (end >= points[i][0]) {
                end = min(points[i][1], end);
            } else {
                end = points[i][1];
                arrows++;
            }
        }

        return arrows;
    }
};
```

2. **Ending Interval Sort:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();

        if (n == 0) return 0;

        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [&](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });

        int arrows = 1;
        int end = points[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > end) {
                arrows++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }
        }

        return arrows;
    }
};
```
